# LaTeX Resume Template for CSE Students

This is a LaTeX template for creating a professional resume for Computer Science and Engineering students. It is designed to be clean and easy to read, while still providing all the necessary information that employers are looking for.

## Getting Started

To use this template, you will need to have a LaTeX distribution installed on your computer. I recommend using TeX Live for Windows, Mac, or Linux. Once you have LaTeX installed, you can download the template files from this repository.

## Usage

The template is divided into several sections: Contact Information, Education, Work Experience, Skills, and Projects. Each section is marked with a comment in the LaTeX code, and you can easily add or remove sections as needed.

To add your own information, simply edit the template in a text editor or LaTeX editor such as Overleaf. Replace the placeholder text with your own information, and save the file. Then, compile the LaTeX code to create a PDF of your resume.

## Customization

The template is fully customizable, so you can change the colors, fonts, and formatting to suit your needs. If you are comfortable with LaTeX, you can modify the code directly. If not, you can use the template as a starting point and make changes using the editor's graphical interface.

# Build Pdf
Just run the pdfLatex following the name of .tex file
